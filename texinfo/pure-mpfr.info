  Version 0.4, June 03, 2012

  Albert Graef <<Dr.Graef@t-online.de>>

  The GNU MPFR (http://www.mpfr.org/) library is a C library for
multiple-precision floating-point computations with correct rounding.
It is based on GMP (http://gmplib.org) which Pure also uses for its
bigint support.

  This module makes the MPFR multiprecision floats (henceforth referred
to as `mpfr' numbers or values) available in Pure, so that they work
with the other types of Pure numbers in an almost seamless fashion.
Pure `mpfr' values are represented as pointers which can readily be
passed as arguments to the MPFR functions, so the representation only
involves minimal overhead on the Pure side.

  The module defines the type of `mpfr' values as an instance of Pure's
`real' type, so that it becomes a well-behaved citizen of Pure's numeric
tower. Memory management of these values is automatic. You can create an
`mpfr' value from any other kind of Pure real value (`int', `bigint' or
`double'), or from a string in decimal notation, using the `mpfr'
function. Back conversions are provided from `mpfr' to `int', `bigint',
`double' and `string' (the latter by means of a custom pretty-printer
installed by this module, so that mpfr values are printed in a format
similar to the `printf %g' format). Integration with Pure's `complex'
type is provided as well.

  Please note that this module needs more testing and the API hasn't
been finalized yet, but it should be perfectly usable already. As
usual, please report any bugs on the Pure issue tracker, on the Pure
mailing list, or directly to the author, see
<http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/>.

2 Installation
**************

Get the latest source from
<http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/files/pure-mpfr-0.4.tar.gz>.

  Run `make' to compile the module and `make install' (as root) to
install it in the Pure library directory. This requires GNU make, and
of course you need to have Pure and libmpfr installed.

  `make' tries to guess your Pure installation directory and
platform-specific setup. If it gets this wrong, you can set some
variables manually, please check the Makefile for details.

     Note: This module requires Pure 0.50 or later and libmpfr 3.x
     (3.0.0 has been tested). Older libmpfr versions (2.x) probably
     require some work.

3 Usage
*******

After installation, you can use the operations of this module by
placing the following import declaration in your Pure programs:

    using mpfr;


     Note: This also pulls in the `math' standard library module, whose
     operations are overloaded by the `mpfr' module in order to provide
     support for `mpfr' values. Thus you don't need to explicitly
     import the `math' module when using the `mpfr' module.

     If you use both the *note mpfr: 2. module and the `pointers'
     standard library module in your script, make sure that you import
     the `pointers' module _after_ `mpfr', so that the definitions of
     pointer arithmetic in the `pointers' module do not interfere with
     the overloading of arithmetic operations in the `mpfr' module.

3.1 Precision and Rounding
==========================

The following operations of the MPFR library are provided to inspect and
change the default precision and rounding modes used by MPFR.

 -- Function: mpfr_get_default_prec
 -- Function: mpfr_set_default_prec prec
     Get and set the default precision in terms of number of bits in the
     mantissa, including the sign. MPFR initially sets this to 53
     (matching the mantissa size of `double' values). It can be changed
     to any desired value not less than 2.

 -- Function: mpfr_get_prec x
     Get the precision of an `mpfr' number `x'. Note that `mpfr' numbers
     always keep the precision they were created with, but it is
     possible to create a new `mpfr' number with any given precision
     from an existing `mpfr' number using the *note mpfr: b. function,
     see below.

 -- Function: mpfr_get_default_rounding_mode
 -- Function: mpfr_set_default_rounding_mode rnd
     Get and set the default rounding mode, which is used for all
     arithmetic operations and mathematical functions provided by this
     module. The given rounding mode `rnd' must be one of the supported
     rounding modes listed below.

 -- constant: MPFR_RNDN // round to nearest, with ties to even
 -- constant: MPFR_RNDZ // round toward zero
 -- constant: MPFR_RNDU // round toward +Inf
 -- constant: MPFR_RNDD // round toward -Inf
 -- constant: MPFR_RNDA // round away from zero
     Supported rounding modes. Please check the MPFR documentation for
     details.

  In addition, the following operations enable you to control the
precision in textual representations of `mpfr' values. This information
is used by the custom pretty-printer for `mpfr' values installed by the
module.

 -- Function: mpfr_get_print_prec
 -- Function: mpfr_set_print_prec prec
     Get and set the precision (number of decimal digits in the
     mantissa) used by the pretty-printer.

3.2 MPFR Numbers
================

The module defines the following data type for representing `mpfr'
values, which is a subtype of the Pure `real' type:

 -- type: mpfr
     This is a tagged pointer type (denoted `mpfr*' in Pure extern
     declarations) which is compatible with the `mpfr_t' and `mpfr_ptr'
     data types of the MPFR C library. Members of this type are
     "cooked" pointers, which are allocated dynamically and freed
     automatically when they are garbage-collected (by means of a
     corresponding Pure sentry).

 -- Function: mpfrp x
     Type predicate checking for `mpfr' values.


File: pure-mpfr.info,  Node: Conversions,  Next: Arithmetic,  Prev: MPFR Numbers,  Up: Usage

3.3 Conversions
===============

The following operations are provided to convert between `mpfr' numbers
and other kinds of Pure `real' values.

 -- Function: mpfr x
 -- Function: mpfr (x,prec)
 -- Function: mpfr (x,prec,rnd)
     This function converts any real number (`int', `bigint', `double',
     `rational', *note mpfr: 16.) to an `mpfr' value.

     Optionally, it is possible to specify a precision (number of bits
     in the mantissa) `prec' and a rounding mode `rnd' (one of the
     `MPFR_RND' constants), otherwise MPFR's default precision and
     rounding mode are used (see *note Precision and Rounding: 7.
     above). Note that this function may also be used to convert an
     `mpfr' to a new `mpfr' number, possibly with a different precision
     and rounding.

     The argument `x' can also be a string denoting a floating point
     number in decimal notation with optional sign, decimal point
     and/or scaling factor, which is parsed and converted to an `mpfr'
     number using the corresponding MPFR function.

 -- Function: int x
 -- Function: bigint x
 -- Function: double x
     Convert an `mpfr' number x to the corresponding type of real
     number.  Please note that there is no `rational' conversion, as
     MPFR does not provide such an operation, but if you need this then
     you can first convert `x' to a `double' and then apply the
     standard library `rational' function to it (this may loose
     precision, of course).

 -- Function: str x
     By virtue of the custom pretty-printer provided by this module, the
     standard library `str' function can be used to obtain a printable
     representation of an `mpfr' number `x' in decimal notation. The
     result is a string.

 -- Function: floor x
 -- Function: ceil x
 -- Function: round x
 -- Function: trunc x
 -- Function: frac x
     Rounding and truncation functions. These all take and yield `mpfr'
     numbers. *note frac: 23. returns the fractional part of an `mpfr'
     number, i.e., `x-trunc x'.

3.4 Arithmetic
==============

The following standard operators (see the `purelib') are overloaded to
provide `mpfr' arithmetic and comparisons. These all handle mixed
`mpfr'/`real' operands.

 -- Function: - x
 -- Function: x + y
 -- Function: x - y
 -- Function: x * y
 -- Function: x / y
 -- Function: x ^ y
     Arithmetic operations.

 -- Function: x == y
 -- Function: x ~= y
 -- Function: x <= y
 -- Function: x >= y
 -- Function: x < y
 -- Function: x > y
     Comparisons.

3.5 Math Functions
==================

The following functions from the `math' module are overloaded to provide
support for `mpfr' values. Note that it is also possible to invoke the
corresponding functions from the MPFR library in a direct fashion,
using the same function names with an additional `_mpfr' suffix. These
functions also accept other kinds of `real' arguments which are
converted to `mpfr' before applying the MPFR function.

 -- Function: abs x
     Absolute value (this is implemented directly, so there's no
     corresponding `_mpfr' function for this).

 -- Function: sqrt x
 -- Function: exp x
 -- Function: ln x
 -- Function: log x
     Square root, exponential and logarithms.

 -- Function: sin x
 -- Function: cos x
 -- Function: tan x
 -- Function: asin x
 -- Function: acos x
 -- Function: atan x
 -- Function: atan2 y x
     Trigonometric functions.

 -- Function: sinh x
 -- Function: cosh x
 -- Function: tanh x
 -- Function: asinh x
 -- Function: acosh x
 -- Function: atanh x
     Hyperbolic trigonometric functions.

3.6 Complex Number Support
==========================

The following functions from the `math' module are overloaded to provide
support for complex values involving `mpfr' numbers:

 -- Function: complex x
 -- Function: polar x
 -- Function: rect x
 -- Function: cis x
 -- Function: arg x
 -- Function: re x
 -- Function: im x
 -- Function: conj x

4 Examples
**********

Import the module and set the default precision:

    > using mpfr;
    > mpfr_set_default_prec 64; // extended precision (long double on x86)
    ()

Calculate pi with the current precision. Note that mixed arithmetic
works with any combination of real and mpfr numbers.

    > let Pi = 4*atan (mpfr 1);
    > pi; Pi; abs (Pi-pi);
    3.14159265358979
    3.14159265358979323851
    1.22514845490862001043e-16

    > let Pi2 = Pi^2;
    > Pi2; sqrt Pi2; sqrt Pi2 == Pi;
    9.86960440108935861941
    3.14159265358979323851
    1

You can also query the precision of a number and change it on the fly:

    > Pi; mpfr_get_prec Pi;
    3.14159265358979323851
    64
    > let Pi1 = mpfr (Pi,53); Pi1; mpfr_get_prec Pi1;
    3.1415926535897931
    53

Complex `mpfr' numbers work, too:

    > let z = mpfr 2^(1/i); z;
    0.769238901363972126565+:-0.638961276313634801184
    > let z = ln z/ln (mpfr 2); z;
    0.0+:-1.0
    > abs z, arg z;
    1.0,-1.57079632679489661926
    > polar z;
    1.0<:-1.57079632679489661926
