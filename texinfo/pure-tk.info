1 Introduction
**************

This module provides a basic interface between Pure and Tcl/Tk. The
operations of this module allow you to execute arbitrary commands in
the Tcl interpreter, set and retrieve variable values in the
interpreter, and invoke Pure callbacks from Tcl/Tk.

  A recent version of Tcl/Tk is required (8.0 or later should do). You
can get this from <http://www.tcl.tk>. Both releases in source form and
binary releases for Windows and various Unix systems are provided there.

  Some information on how to use this module can be found below. But
you'll find that pure-tk is very easy to use, so you might just want to
look at the programs in the examples folder to pick it up at a glance.
A very basic example can be found in tk_hello.pure; a slightly more
advanced example of a tiny but complete Tk application is in
tk_examp.pure.

  pure-tk also offers special support for Peter G. Baum's Gnocl
(http://www.gnocl.org/) extension which turns Tcl into a frontend for
GTK+ (http://www.gtk.org/) and Gnome (http://www.gnome.org/). If you
have Gnocl installed then you can easily create GTK+/Gnome
applications, either from Tcl sources or from Glade
(http://glade.gnome.org/) UI files, using the provided gnocl.pure
module. See the included uiexample.pure and the accompanying Glade UI
file for a simple example. Also, some basic information on using Gnocl
with pure-tk can be found in the *note Tips and Tricks: 4. section
below.

  One nice thing about Tcl/Tk is that it provides a bridge to a lot of
other useful libraries. A prominent example is VTK
(http://www.vtk.org/), a powerful open-source 3D visualization toolkit
which comes with full Tcl/Tk bindings. The examples directory contains
a simple example (earth.pure and earth.tcl) which shows how you can
employ these bindings to write cool animated 3D applications using
either Tk or Gnocl as the GUI toolkit.

3 Installation
**************

Get the latest source from
<http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/files/pure-tk-0.3.tar.gz>.

  As with the other addon modules for Pure, running `make && sudo make
install' should usually do the trick. This requires that you have Pure
and Tcl/Tk installed. `make' tries to guess your Pure installation
directory and platform-specific setup. If it gets this wrong, you can
set some variables manually. In particular, `make install prefix=/usr'
sets the installation prefix. Please see the Makefile for details.

     Note: When starting a new interpreter, the Tcl/Tk initialization
     code looks for some initialization files which it executes before
     anything else happens. Usually these files will be found without
     any further ado, but if that does not happen automatically, you
     must set the TCL_LIBRARY and TK_LIBRARY environment variables to
     point to the Tcl and Tk library directories on your system.

  All programs in the examples subdirectory have been set up so that
they can be compiled to native executables, and a Makefile is provided
in that directory to handle this. So after installing pure-tk you just
need to type `make' there to compile the examples. (This step isn't
necessary, though, you can also just run the examples with the Pure
interpreter as usual.)

4 Basic Usage
*************

 -- Function: tk cmd
     execute a Tcl command

  You can submit a command to the Tcl interpreter with `tk cmd' where
`cmd' is a string containing the command to be executed. If the Tcl
command returns a value (i.e., a nonempty string) then *note tk: d.
returns that string, otherwise it returns `()'.

  *note tk: d. also starts a new instance of the Tcl interpreter if it
is not already running. To stop the Tcl interpreter, you can use the
*note tk_quit: e.  function.

 -- Function: tk_quit
     stop the Tcl interpreter

  Note that, as far as pure-tk is concerned, there's only one Tcl
interpreter per process, but of course you can create secondary
interpreter instances in the Tcl interpreter using the appropriate Tcl
commands.

  Simple dialogs can be created directly using Tk's `tk_messageBox' and
`tk_dialog' functions. For instance:

    tk "tk_dialog .warning \"Warning\" \"Are you sure?\" warning 0 Yes No Cancel";

Other kinds of common dialogs are available; see the Tcl/Tk manual for
information.

  For more elaborate applications you probably have to explicitly
create some widgets, add the appropriate callbacks and provide a main
loop which takes care of processing events in the Tcl/Tk GUI. We
discuss this in the following.


File: pure-tk.info,  Node: Callbacks,  Next: The Main Loop,  Prev: Basic Usage,  Up: Top

5 Callbacks
***********

pure-tk installs a special Tcl command named `pure' in the interpreter
which can be used to implement callbacks in Pure. This command is
invoked from Tcl as follows:

    pure function args ...

It calls the Pure function named by the first argument, passing any
remaining (string) arguments to the callback. If the Pure callback
returns a (nonempty) string, that value becomes the return value of the
`pure' command, otherwise the result returned to the Tcl interpreter is
empty.

  Pure callbacks are installed on Tk widgets just like any other, just
using the `pure' command as the actual callback command. For instance,
you can define a callback which gets invoked when a button is pushed as
follows:

    using tk, system;
    tk "button .b -text {Hello, world!} -command {pure hello}; pack .b";
    hello = puts "Hello, world!";

6 The Main Loop
***************

 -- Function: tk_main
     call the Tk main loop

  The easiest way to provide a main loop for your application is to
just call *note tk_main: 11. which keeps processing events in the Tcl
interpreter until the interpreter is exited. You can terminate the
interpreter in a Pure callback by calling *note tk_quit: e. Thus a
minimalistic Tcl/Tk application coded in Pure may look as follows:

    using tk;
    tk "button .b -text {Hello, world!} -command {pure tk_quit}; pack .b";
    tk_main;

The main loop terminates as soon as the Tcl interpreter is exited,
which can happen, e.g., in response to a callback which invokes the
*note tk_quit: e.  function (as shown above) or Tcl code which destroys
the main window (`destroy .').  The user can also close the main window
from the window manager in order to exit the main loop.

7 Accessing Tcl Variables
*************************

 -- Function: tk_set var val
 -- Function: tk_unset var
 -- Function: tk_get var
     set and get Tcl variables

  pure-tk allows your script to set and retrieve variable values in the
Tcl interpreter with the *note tk_set: 13, *note tk_unset: 14. and
*note tk_get: 15.  functions. This is useful, e.g., to change the
variables associated with entry and button widgets, and to retrieve the
current values from the application. For instance:

    > tk_set "entry_val" "some string";
    "some string"
    > tk_get "entry_val";
    "some string"
    > tk_unset "entry_val";
    ()
    > tk_get "entry_val";
    tk_get "entry_val"

Note that *note tk_set: 13. returns the assigned value, so it is
possible to chain such calls if several variables have to be set to the
same value:

    > tk_set "foo" $ tk_set "bar" "yes";
    "yes"
    > map tk_get ["foo","bar"];
    ["yes","yes"]

8 Conversions Between Pure and Tcl Values
*****************************************

As far as pure-tk is concerned, all Tcl values are strings (in fact,
that's just what they are at the Tcl language level, although the Tcl
interpreter uses more elaborate representations of objects such as
lists internally).  There are no automatic conversions of any kind.
Thus, the arguments passed to a Pure callback and the result returned
by *note tk: d. are simply strings in Pure land. The same holds for the
*note tk_set: 13. and *note tk_get: 15. functions.

  However, there are a few helper functions which can be used to
convert between Tcl and Pure data. First, the following operations
convert Pure lists to corresponding Tcl lists and vice versa:

 -- Function: tk_join xs
 -- Function: tk_split s
     convert between Pure and Tcl lists

    > tk_join ["0","1.0","Hello, world!"];
    "0 1.0 {Hello, world!}"
    > tk_split ans;
    ["0","1.0","Hello, world!"]

The *note tk_str: 19. and *note tk_val: 1a. operations work in a
similar fashion, but they also do automatic conversions for numeric
values (ints, bigints and doubles):

 -- Function: tk_str xs
 -- Function: tk_val s
     convert between Pure and Tcl values with numeric conversions

    > tk_str [0,1.0,"Hello, world!"];
    "0 1.0 {Hello, world!}"
    > tk_val ans;
    [0,1.0,"Hello, world!"]

In addition, these operations also convert single atomic values:

    > tk_str 1.0;
    "1.0"
    > tk_val ans;
    1.0

9 Tips and Tricks
*****************

Here are a few other things that are worth keeping in mind when working
with pure-tk.

   * Errors in Tcl/Tk commands can be handled by giving an appropriate
     definition of the `tk_error' function, which is invoked with an
     error message as its single argument. For instance, the following
     implementation of `tk_error' throws an exception:

         tk_error msg = throw msg;

     If no definition for this function is provided, then errors cause
     a literal `tk_error msg' expression to be returned as the result
     of the *note tk: d.  function. You can then check for such results
     and take an appropriate action.

   * The Tcl interpreter, when started, displays a default main window,
     which is required by most Tk applications. If this is not desired
     (e.g., if only the basic Tcl commands are needed), you can hide
     this window using a `tk "wm withdraw ."' command. To redisplay the
     window when it is needed, use the `tk "wm deiconify ."' command.
     It is also common practice to use `wm withdraw' and `wm deiconify'
     while creating the widgets of an application, in order to reduce
     "flickering".

   * Instead of calling *note tk_main: 11, you can also code your own
     main loop in Pure as follows:

         main = do_something $$ main if tk_ready;
              = () otherwise;

     Note that the `tk_ready' function checks whether the Tcl
     interpreter is still up and running, after processing any pending
     events in the interpreter. This setup allows you to do your own
     custom idle processing in Pure while the application is running.
     However, you have to be careful that your `do_something' routine
     runs neither too short nor too long (a few milliseconds should
     usually be ok). Otherwise your main loop may turn into a busy loop
     and/or the GUI may become very sluggish and unresponsive. Thus
     it's usually better to just call *note tk_main: 11. and do any
     necessary background processing using the Tcl interpreter's own
     facilities (e.g., by setting up a Pure callback with the Tcl
     `after' command).

   * The *note tk: d. function can become rather tedious when coding
     larger Tk applications. Usually, you will prefer to put the
     commands making up your application into a separate Tcl script.
     One way to incorporate the Tcl script into your your Pure program
     is to use the Tcl `source' command, e.g.:

         tk "source myapp.tcl";

     However, this always requires the script to be available at
     runtime. Another method is to read the script into a string which
     is assigned to a Pure constant, and then invoke the *note tk: d.
     command on this string value:

         using system;
         const ui = fget $ fopen "myapp.tcl" "r";
         tk ui;

     This still reads the script at runtime if the Pure program is
     executed using the Pure interpreter. However, you can now compile
     the Pure program to a native executable (see the Pure manual for
     details on this), in which case the text of the Tcl script is
     included verbatim in the executable. The compiled program can then
     be run without having the original Tcl script file available:

         $ pure -c myapp.pure -o myapp
         $ ./myapp

     This is also the method to use for running existing Tk
     applications, e.g., if you create the interface using some
     interface builder like vtcl (http://vtcl.sourceforge.net).

   * The Tcl `package' command allows you to load additional extensions
     into the Tcl interpreter at runtime. For instance:

         tk "package require Gnocl";

     This loads Peter G. Baum's Gnocl (http://www.gnocl.org/) extension
     which turns Tcl into a frontend for GTK+ (http://www.gtk.org/) and
     Gnome (http://www.gnome.org/). In fact, pure-tk includes a special
     module to handle the nitty-gritty details of creating a GTK+/Gnome
     application from a Glade (http://glade.gnome.org/) UI file and set
     up Pure callbacks as specified in the UI file. To use this, just
     import the gnocl.pure module into your Pure scripts:

         using gnocl;

     Note that the Glade interface requires that you have a fairly
     recent version of Gnocl installed (Gnocl 0.9.94g has been tested).
     The other facilities provided by the gnocl.pure module should also
     work with older Gnocl versions such as Gnocl 0.9.91. Please see
     the gnocl.pure module and the corresponding examples included in
     the sources for more information.

   * The Tcl `exit' procedure, just as in tclsh or wish, causes exit
     from the current process. Since the Tcl interpreter hosted by the
     pure-tk module runs as part of a Pure program and not as a
     separate child process, this might not be what you want. If you'd
     like `exit' to only exit the Tcl interpreter, without exiting the
     Pure program, you can redefine the `exit' procedure, e.g., as
     follows:

         tk "proc exit { {returnCode 0} } { pure tk_quit }";

     If you want to do something with the exit code provided by `exit',
     you will have to provide an appropriate callback function, e.g.:

         tk "proc exit { {returnCode 0} } { pure quit_cb $returnCode }";

     A suitable implementation of `quit_cb' might look as follows:

         quit_cb 0 = puts "Application exited normally." $$ tk_quit;
         quit_cb n = printf "Application exited with exit code %d.\n" n $$
                     tk_quit otherwise;


   * If you need dialogs beyond the standard kinds of message boxes and
     common dialogs, you will have to do these yourself using a
     secondary toplevel. The dialog toplevel is just like the main
     window but will only be shown when the application needs it. You
     can construct both non-modal and modal dialogs this way, the
     latter can be implemented using Tk's `grab' command.
