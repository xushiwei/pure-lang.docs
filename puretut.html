<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This tutorial introduces the Pure programming language by way of examples,
explaining the major elements and concepts of the language along the way. The
goal is to help you to quickly gather a basic understanding of Pure and master
the initial learning curve.</p>
<p>This document does not pretend to be an introduction to programming in
general, so it certainly helps if you already have an idea what programming is
all about and some familiarity with at least one other programming language
such as C, Python or Lisp. Also, we don&#8217;t give an exhaustive account of the
Pure language, although we aim to discuss the most important language elements
in some detail. Therefore you should consult the other available
documentation, in particular <a class="reference internal" href="pure.html"><em>The Pure Manual</em></a>, if you want to learn more.</p>
<p>So what is Pure, anyway? First, it is a <strong class="dfn">functional</strong> language, like, say, Lisp
and Haskell, but don&#8217;t let this scare you. Functional programming languages
have a reputation of being difficult to use, which isn&#8217;t entirely undeserved
in some cases, but the difficulties are often due to a lack of familiarity, as
most programmers today still learn their craft using <strong class="dfn">imperative</strong> languages
such as Pascal, C and Java. It is no wonder that they are then at a loss when
they first encounter a language which does (some, not all) things a bit
differently. Fortunately, mainstream languages have been picking up powerful
and convenient features from functional languages left and right, so that
these features nowadays will be a lot more familiar to programmers than, say,
20 years ago. In any case, we hope that after working though this tutorial you
get the feeling that Pure lets you solve many typical programming tasks just
as easily and elegantly as other programming languages, and in many cases even
much <em>more</em> easily and elegantly.</p>
<p>Second, Pure uses <strong class="dfn">term rewriting</strong> as its model of computation. What this
basically means is that all your function definitions are essentially
collections of equations which are used to evaluate expressions in a symbolic
fashion. This is probably one of Pure&#8217;s most unusual aspects, but it gives the
language a lot of power and flexibility. It is also surprisingly easy to
understand once you grasp that, on an abstract level, all computations
performed by the interpreter are really nothing but sequences of simple
algebraic manipulations.</p>
<p>Third, Pure is a <strong class="dfn">dynamically typed</strong> language. This is a conscious design
decision motivated by the choice of computational model, but it also keeps the
language simple and supports a freewheeling, interactive development style.
Still, Pure programs are compiled to native code, so that they are executed
with reasonable efficiency. Pure can&#8217;t really compete with compiled statically
typed languages such as Haskell and ML in terms of speed and type safety, but
it&#8217;s a small yet powerful language which is supposed to be both easy to learn
and fun to use.</p>
<p>Fourth, Pure provides a seamless interface to <strong class="dfn">external functions</strong> written in
C, C++ and Fortran, and thus is open to the imperative world out there and its
wealth of useful software libraries. To these ends, despite its name, Pure
decidedly is not a “purely” functional language. Performing I/O and doing all
kinds of other side-effects is very easy in Pure. In fact, the ease with which
you can integrate functions from external libraries and the interactive
interpreter-like environment also turn Pure into a useful <strong class="dfn">scripting language</strong>
for many different purposes.</p>
<p class="rubric">Typographical Conventions</p>
<p>Throughout the entire Pure documentation, Pure programs are set in typewriter
font (adding a moderate amount of syntax highlighting for easier reading). For
instance, here is a little Pure program which defines the factorial function:</p>
<div class="highlight-pure"><div class="highlight"><pre>fact n = <span class="kr">if</span> n&gt;<span class="mi">0</span> <span class="kr">then</span> n*fact (n-<span class="mi">1</span>) <span class="kr">else</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Such code fragments can be entered directly at the interpreter&#8217;s prompt, but
usually you will want to put them into a text file which can then be loaded in
the interpreter, as described in the following section.</p>
<p>Often we will also show sample interactions with the Pure interpreter in order
to explain how the programs are to be used. For instance, an invocation of the
above factorial function may look as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-pure"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt; </span>map fact (<span class="mi">1</span>..<span class="mi">10</span>)<span class="p">;</span>
[<span class="mi">1</span>,<span class="mi">2</span>,<span class="mi">6</span>,<span class="mi">24</span>,<span class="mi">120</span>,<span class="mi">720</span>,<span class="mi">5040</span>,<span class="mi">40320</span>,<span class="mi">362880</span>,<span class="mi">3628800</span>]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this example, you are supposed to type <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">map</span> <span class="pre">fact</span> <span class="pre">(1..10);</span></tt> at the command
prompt of the interpreter, after which the result
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[1,2,6,24,120,720,5040,40320,362880,3628800]</span></tt> will be printed. In general,
all text after the prompt &#8220;&gt; &#8221; is meant to be typed exactly as written
(including the terminating semicolon), while the other lines indicate results
and other responses printed by the interpreter.</p>
<p>In some cases we will show commands to be typed at your system&#8217;s command
shell, which are indicated as follows (here &#8220;$ &#8221; is taken to denote the shell
command prompt, which of course varies for different systems):</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> pure factorial.pure
</pre></div>
</div>

<div class="section" id="getting-started">
<h2>Getting Started<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let us start out with a very brief overview of the Pure environment, so that
you get a basic understanding of how all the bits and pieces fit together. For
the sake of brevity, we strictly keep to the basics which are unlikely to
change much with future releases of the Pure environment. For more detailed
and up-to-date information, please refer to the <a class="reference external" href="http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/">Pure website</a>, where you can
find the required software and all available documentation, as well as a wiki
with additional helpful information. (Since you&#8217;re reading this tutorial, most
likely you have already discovered this.)  Another very useful resource is the
<a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/pure-lang">Pure mailing list</a> where you can discuss Pure with fellow Pure programmers
and ask any questions that you might have.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-pure-interpreter">
<h3>The Pure Interpreter<a class="headerlink" href="#the-pure-interpreter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Pure language is implemented by an interactive program which lets you
enter Pure programs and execute them. This program is called the Pure
<strong class="dfn">interpreter</strong>. If you have used any kind of dynamic programming language such
as Lisp, Python or Ruby then you should already be familiar with this
concept.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>So the first thing that you&#8217;ll have to do in order to use Pure is to install
the interpreter. For most examples in this text a basic installation
(consisting of just the &#8220;pure&#8221; package containing the interpreter and the
standard library) should be all that&#8217;s needed. If some piece of code in this
text requires any additional software, we will tell you where to find it in
due course.</p>
<p>The details of installing the interpreter vary depending on which operating
system you use. You should first check whether there&#8217;s a binary package for
your system, this will make things easier. Otherwise you&#8217;ll have to build the
interpreter from source code. The necessary steps to do that are rather
straightforward once you have all the requisite tools and libraries installed.
In particular, you&#8217;ll need the <a class="reference external" href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU C++ compiler</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/s/make/">GNU make</a> to compile
the program, as well as the <a class="reference external" href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM library</a> which provides the compiler
back-end the Pure interpreter uses to translate your Pure programs to
executable code. Detailed installation instructions can be found in the
<a class="reference internal" href="install.html"><em>Installing Pure (and LLVM)</em></a> manual.</p>
<p>Having completed the installation, you should be able to invoke the
interpreter from the command line just like any other program:</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> pure
<span class="go">Pure 0.56 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu) Copyright (c) 2008-2011 by Albert Graef</span>
<span class="go">(Type &#39;help&#39; for help, &#39;help copying&#39; for license information.)</span>
<span class="go">Loaded prelude from /usr/local/lib/pure/prelude.pure.</span>

<span class="gp">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the interpreter greets you with a little sign-on message, so
that you know that it&#8217;s up and running and which version you have, and then
leaves you at its command prompt. At this point you can start typing Pure
code, such as definitions and expressions to be evaluated:</p>
<div class="highlight-pure"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt; </span>fact n = <span class="kr">if</span> n&gt;<span class="mi">0</span> <span class="kr">then</span> n*fact (n-<span class="mi">1</span>) <span class="kr">else</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt; </span>map fact (<span class="mi">1</span>..<span class="mi">10</span>)<span class="p">;</span>
[<span class="mi">1</span>,<span class="mi">2</span>,<span class="mi">6</span>,<span class="mi">24</span>,<span class="mi">120</span>,<span class="mi">720</span>,<span class="mi">5040</span>,<span class="mi">40320</span>,<span class="mi">362880</span>,<span class="mi">3628800</span>]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Proceeding in this fashion, you can readily use the interpreter as a
sophisticated kind of desktop calculator. Note, however, that even when
entering Pure code interactively, you always have to terminate definitions and
expressions with a semicolon, as shown above. In contrast to languages like
Python, &#8220;whitespace&#8221; (that is, blanks, tabs and even newlines) are
insignificant. That has the advantage that you can break complicated
definitions and expressions into multiple lines without having to escape line
ends. On the other hand, it means that the interpreter will just keep on
sitting idle if you forget to enter the terminating semicolon. This may well
happen quite a bit when you begin using Pure, but is nothing to worry about;
just enter the semicolon on a line by itself to initiate the computation:</p>
<div class="highlight-pure"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt; </span><span class="mi">6</span>*<span class="mi">7</span> <span class="c1">// oops, forgot the semicolon here</span>
<span class="gp">&gt; </span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="mi">42</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To exit from the interpreter when you&#8217;re finished, simply type the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">quit</span></tt>
command (or the end-of-file character, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl-D</span></tt> on Linux, Mac OSX and other
Unix-like systems) at the beginning of the command line, immediately after the
prompt. This will return you to the shell:</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;</span> quit
<span class="gp">$</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Often you may prefer to enter Pure code in a text editor and save it in a text
file, called a <strong class="dfn">script</strong>, which can then be loaded in the interpreter. This can
be done by specifying the name of the script file when invoking the
interpreter:<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a></p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> pure -i factorial.pure
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Instead, you can also run the script directly from the interpreter&#8217;s command
prompt like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-pure"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt; </span>run factorial.pure
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The interpreter normally offers support for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/s/readline/">GNU readline</a> library, which
lets you recall previously entered lines, edit them and resubmit the edited
lines to the interpreter. This includes a history of past input lines which
gets saved and reloaded whenever you exit and restart the interpreter. Another
convenient readline feature is the completion of Pure keywords and functions.</p>
<p>It is also possible to edit and run scripts from the Emacs text editor, using
Emacs Pure mode, and there is syntax highlighting support for a number of
other text editors. More information about alternative ways to invoke the Pure
interpreter can be found on the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/wiki/UsingPure">Using Pure</a> wiki page, and the interactive
features of the interpreter are discussed at length in the corresponding
section of <a class="reference internal" href="pure.html"><em>The Pure Manual</em></a>. Also, the <a class="reference internal" href="install.html"><em>Installing Pure (and LLVM)</em></a> document explains in detail
what you need to do to set up Pure mode for use with Emacs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-standard-library">
<h3>The Standard Library<a class="headerlink" href="#the-standard-library" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To equip the language with some useful programming facilities which will be
used in almost every Pure program, an installation of the Pure interpreter
always comes with a collection of Pure scripts which are collectively referred
to as Pure&#8217;s <strong class="dfn">standard library</strong>. A subset of the standard library, called the
<strong class="dfn">prelude</strong>, is in fact loaded by default whenever you invoke the interpreter.
The prelude defines most of the basic operations of the Pure language, such as
arithmetic, logic, string and list processing. Without the prelude the
interpreter won&#8217;t be of much use for anything, so the first time you run the
interpreter you should check that the prelude was properly loaded, which is
indicated by a line like the following at the end of the sign-on message:</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">Loaded prelude from /usr/local/lib/pure/prelude.pure.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If instead you see an error message which says that the prelude wasn&#8217;t found,
then there is some problem with your Pure installation which needs to be fixed
before you can proceed. Maybe the library got installed in the wrong place or
with the wrong access permissions, or the files are just missing. If you can&#8217;t
figure it out by yourself, consult a local computer wizard, contact the
maintainer of the package that you used to install Pure, or ask for help on
the <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/pure-lang">Pure mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Besides the prelude, the standard library contains additional scripts or
<strong class="dfn">modules</strong> which can be loaded when they are needed, by means of a special kind
of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">using</span></tt> declaration, also called an <strong class="dfn">import clause</strong>. For instance, the
standard library function <a class="reference internal" href="purelib.html#sqrt" title="sqrt"><tt class="xref pure pure-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">sqrt</span></tt></a>, which computes the square root of a
number, is contained in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">math.pure</span></tt> library script, which can be loaded
as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-pure"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt; </span><span class="kr">using</span> math<span class="p">;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt; </span>sqrt <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="mf">1.4142135623731</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that you only have to specify the basename of the script file here, the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.pure</span></tt> filename extension will be added automatically.</p>
<p>There are a number of other useful modules in the standard library which we
will introduce as we go along; for the gory details, you may refer to the
<a class="reference internal" href="purelib.html"><em>Pure Library Manual</em></a>. In addition, there is a growing collection of so-called <strong class="dfn">addon
modules</strong>, which don&#8217;t ship with the interpreter but can be installed
separately. You can find an overview of these on the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/wiki/Addons">Addons</a> wiki page. And if
all that is not enough for your programming needs, Pure also allows you to
interface to existing code in other programming languages, such as C and
Fortran, quite easily. With the wealth of ready-made libraries available on
modern computer systems, this is a real boon, and we will discuss the
corresponding facilities of the Pure language later on in this tutorial.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hello-world">
<h3>Hello, World<a class="headerlink" href="#hello-world" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Assuming that you managed to get the Pure interpreter up and running, you&#8217;re
now ready to write and execute your first Pure program a.k.a. script. It&#8217;s
customary to start out with a little program which just prints the text
&#8220;Hello, world&#8221; on the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight-pure"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kr">using</span> system<span class="p">;</span>
puts <span class="s">&quot;Hello, world&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This should be very familiar to C programmers; it is indeed the <a class="reference internal" href="purelib.html#puts" title="puts"><tt class="xref pure pure-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">puts</span></tt></a>
function from the C library which is being called here. Note that no special
&#8220;main&#8221; function is needed; the call to <a class="reference internal" href="purelib.html#puts" title="puts"><tt class="xref pure pure-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">puts</span></tt></a> will be evaluated just
like any other toplevel expression while the program is being executed. You
can put the two lines above into a file called, say, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hello.pure</span></tt> which can
then be invoked from the command line as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> pure hello.pure
<span class="go">Hello, world</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That&#8217;s it. Congrats, you have just successfully executed your first Pure
program!</p>

this on the fly, whenever the code first needs to be executed; this is also
known as <strong class="dfn">JIT</strong> (&#8220;just in time&#8221;) compilation. All this happens
